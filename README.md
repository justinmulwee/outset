# What is Outset?
A bleeding-edge boilerplate for opinionated minimalists coding static websites. It has:

- Sass libraries written by Thoughtbot.
- barebones Jade markup templates written by me.
- a sensible folder structure
- Prepros config file to make things compile client-side automatically.

It's simply my preferred starting point for creating semantically pure, organized and DRY website code. It's ready to go for Prepros but you could also use Codekit or grunt pretty easily.

In an age of fancy CMSs and frameworks, this is a reminder that there's nothing wrong with static sites. Unless you have a somewhat tech savvy client who's going to make regular updates to their own site, then building on any CMS is like using a combustion engine to make toast. Yes, even a cool CMS like Grav or Ghost. 

At the same time, you’ll probably want to do things like share the header and footer between pages, use simple variables, cascade your stylesheets, sometimes invoke a grid. You know, stuff that organized frontend devs do. 

But there's no reason we need a complicated workflow or ANY server requirements to accomplish this. You know what else we don’t need? Bloated, outdated libraries like Bootstrap and Foundation generating non-semantic code and weird CSS behavior.
